## Usage:

At this time the app is still in development, being worked on by a single UWA student. Who only has 6months experience with web developement. But im confident I can get this product to function as intended with more time.\

## Planning:

The idea for this product changed a lot throughout development mostly due to time constraints.
If you are interested in what went into planning this product view the images and links below:

I started with Miro and planned out a user story:

Once I had a solid idea of what i wanted to achieve I wrote a [press release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YMZylozOyr_6TOA9Ju-uYEWSkKFkWu1mavHIqd6BjEg/edit?usp=sharing) and then started some plans and tasks on a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/nxkpbz4W/express-yourself) to keep myself on track.

Once I had all my plans down I [story boarded](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Muils9CKx3C5rS8vdiGQ4TTGdVlqzgBt?usp=sharing) my app which started out as a game but soon changed to this product testing app which you can see after all the game story boards, but I am very excited to continue working on both as separate products.

## Future Plans:

- What does the future hold for EXPRESS-yoURSELF?
- Well first of all I would like to go through and restyle the whole app and give it a more professional look my styling started with the vision that the app was going to be more game related but now that the vision has changed so shall the appearance.
- Next the key feature I need to implement is for the landmark detection to detect emotions. Through my research i am confident I can achieve this.
- once emotions are detected i can focus on recording that data and translating it to a chart using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).\
  Mock up of the chart below:

- I would also like to implement a system where you can save your charts so you can then compare them for more accurate tests. Or even for group testing.
- Once i am happy with the core functionality of the app i plan to start the game aspect, an in build browser based activity where you use your facial expressions to interact with various activities as show in the [story board](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Muils9CKx3C5rS8vdiGQ4TTGdVlqzgBt?usp=sharing) above. I believe this activity will help aid those who struggle with social anxiety or for people on the spectrum to learn about how facial cues can effect the people around them.
- And as always with any project fix the few small bug fixes that i have noticed.
